This directory contains the java source files for a project to implement a binary search tree.

You must complete 1 binary search tree implementation.
BST.java - A simple binary search tree that does not guarantee the tree remains balanced

Your binary search tree must implement both the IBST and ITraversableTree interfaces.

To generate the javadoc for this project:
